# Csharp-versus-Python-challenge
> A challenge between Csharp and Python. Discipline: Word count in a file.

# About
This challenge started like a talk between me and my good friend George. George told me that Python is elegant and easy language to learn. I replied that I have goose bump when I heard Python. Why he asked? Well, because I think than Python is terribly slow and not really elegant language.

I followed with statement that C# is a really elegant language but we have find out which language is really faster.

I have deliberately chosen a word count in file challenge because text operations are strong discipline for Python.

So, George... *Bring it on, bitch!*

BTW: You have to download the releases and you have to have .NET 4.7.1 framework installed. Copy a testing text file called `Text.txt` to the folder where you extract the releases and make your results at your machine.
